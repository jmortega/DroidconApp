For  instance, all data driven apps get data from the network, save data in  your local cache files / databases. And most of the libraries used to  simplify those tasks will use reflection in their core. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Reflection is slow on Android due to limitations of  Dalvik and Art. The usual workaround is to write annotation processors  and replace Reflection by generated code. But, it comes with a price :  all the robust and mature libs from Java can't be reused and must be  rewritten, often in a degraded, simpler version. And the annotation  processor API is quite tricky, leaving this work to a handful of expert  coders.<br /> <br /> In this talk, we will demonstrate a new approach using the Reflection No  Reflection (RNÐ¯). This new technology provides a much faster access to  reflection data, while maintaining compatibility with the Reflection  API. Using this technique, any library can swap out use of the  Reflection API with this interface-compatible implementation to achieve  greater performance.<br /> <br /> It also comes with an additional benefit : if you create annotation  processors based libs, you can now get rid of annotation processing API  when writing an annotation processor : you will be able to use  reflection of classes...Yes, before they are even compiled !","category":"Develop","startDate":"08/27/2015 05:10PM","endDate":"08/27/2015 05:50PM","publicEvent":true,"rsvpCount":1,"speakers":[{"id":25864,"name":"StÃ©phane Nicolas","profile":"With around 20 years of experience of Java programming, St&eacute;phane has been teaching programming and software design for more than seven years to scholars and young professionals.

However, this simplicity is often misleading as Gradle scripts have the potential for much more intricate behaviors than XML property file build systems. This complexity gap between the simple and the possible often causes roadblocks when an Android developer actually needs to do anything unique during a build. This class will help bridge that complexity gap by diving under the hood to explore how both simple and complicated build scripts actually work.<br /><br />You will learn when and where lines of your build scripts are actually getting executed and what conditions prevent them from changing the state of your build. You'll also learn how you can create reusable code in a multi-app build environment. Finally, you'll hear important tips to make sure your Android Gradle scripts work well within the plugin ecosystem. All these lessons come straight from Jake's experiences developing the Crashlytics plugin for Gradle, which has been used in production by top Android app developers for almost two years. We'll cover advanced Gradle topics, but introduce them in a way that is accessible to newer users.","category":"Develop","startDate":"08/28/2015 11:00AM","endDate":"08/28/2015 11:40AM","publicEvent":true,"rsvpCount":1,"speakers":[{"id":24413,"name":"Jake Ouellette","profile":"Senior Software Engineer at Twitter, focused on developing testable software systems to solve complex problems.

Yes, JSON is very readable, convenient, and offers great support libraries like GSON and Jackson, but these options don&rsquo;t always get the job done.&nbsp;Accessing and parsing serialized data is a common source of runtime inefficiency within applications, and this delay can crush your app&rsquo;s overall user experience. How can you bypass this inefficiency? Google&rsquo;s FlatBuffer library is the answer. FlatBuffers are similar to Google&rsquo;s Protocol Buffers, but with one key differentiator: the ability to access serialized data without parsing or unpacking it first. Imagine a serialization process with no temporary objects, no additional allocation, and no copying. Join us for a deep dive into Google&rsquo;s FlatBuffers library to learn more about the advantages of using FlatBuffers and what makes it different from other commonly used libraries.","category":"Develop","startDate":"08/28/2015 04:20PM","endDate":"08/28/2015 05:00PM","publicEvent":true,"rsvpCount":1,"speakers":[{"id":24410,"name":"Christopher Brown","profile":"Chris Brown currently serves as Principle Mobile Engineer and Lead Developer for the priceline.com Android team.
